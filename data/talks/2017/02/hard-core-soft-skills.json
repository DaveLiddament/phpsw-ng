    "abstract": "As developers, our ability to write code is fundamental. It's only logical that when it comes to growing our skills this is where we allocate our resources; on the code. While these hard development skills are inarguably central to the role of a developer, is it possible that soft skills can be just as useful? This talk will very briefly look at soft skills in the context of being a developer and cover: what they are, why are they important and how we can start using them to better our careers and ourselves.",
