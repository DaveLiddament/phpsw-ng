    "description": "We're finishing off 2016 as we have done for the last couple of years and that's with a social.\n\nThe evening will be taking place in a pub - we're just waiting for final confirmation and then we'll announce which one. We'll be putting on a buffet and there will be a drink or two on us for you too.\n\nRather than a full PHPub Quiz as we have done for the last couple of years, we're currently putting together a mix of smaller bits of entertainment for the evening (possibly including a small quiz...), but want to give plenty of time for chatting and socialising too.\n\nThere will, of course, be plenty of prizes! What more could you ask for!\n\nNote: Unfortunately we have had to hold this on the second Tuesday rather than the Wednesday. It wasn't a decision we took lightly, but gave us the best option for venues.",
